        </strong><br />
    <strong><u>Upstairs<br />
    </u></strong>The upstairs apartment (approx 120 square meters or sqm) sleeps 4 with two bedrooms and two bathrooms.<br />
    <br />
    From the entrance on the street level you enter into a terrace above the property. You go down approximately 20 steps to a large terracotta tile terrace with a breathtaking view of the sea. The terrace is decorated with large terracotta vases with a variety of flowers and plants and furnished with a set of wicker furniture (a two-seat sofa, two chairs and a coffee table) and a number of canvas foldable deck-chairs. It is shaded by a very large natural linen market umbrella and a Spanish-style canvas canopy of the same color. At night the terrace is softly illuminated by in-ground lighting hidden behind the terracotta vases and Moroccan style candles lanterns hanging above a outdoor table (for 8) made with a patchwork of Vietri tiles. <br />
    <br />
    Through two large glass arched doors you enter into the <strong>living area</strong>, two wide rooms (ca 50 sqm) with cupola ceilings, a picture window that looks out to the sea and a fireplace. It is simply and elegantly furnished with a white sofa, a round glass &amp; metal coffee table and a set of wicker furniture (a two-seat sofa and two chairs).<br />
<br />
Off the open space outside the living area is the <strong>kitchen </strong>(ca 20 sqm). With a large single glass panel door facing the sea, the eat-in-kitchen has a wooden table that sits 6-8, an extra-spacious travertine sink, a backsplash of antique Neapolitan tiles, wooden and tile countertops, an American-size stainless steel refrigerator, a semiprofessional stove, an electric oven and a quiet dishwasher. The kitchen also has various size espresso machines and a Melita coffee maker.<br />
<strong><br />
The master bedroom </strong>(ca 19 sqm) gets its light and view from a large single glass panel door facing the sea and is furnished with a 19th century cast iron queen-size canopy bed. The wall opposite the bed has built in closets and a desk equipped with a computer with 24x7 access to the Internet, a printer and a fax machine.<br />
<br />
The <strong>bathroom</strong> (ca 5 sqm) has walls painted in the Venetian spatula style and a handmade Vietri tile floor. It has a shower, bidet and sink set on a travertine countertop.<br />
<br />
The <strong>second bedroom</strong> is a small (ca 13 sqm), but lovely, internal bedroom with two twin size beds that can be joined to form a king sized bed. The wall opposite the bed has built-in closets with drawers. &nbsp;&nbsp;To compensate for its size, the bedroom opens into a spacious <strong>second bathroom </strong>(ca 10 sqm) hand painted ochre Venetian spatula walls and a Vietri tiled floor. There is a shower, bathtub, bidet and sink set into a travertine countertop.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Downstairs<br />
</u></strong>The downstairs apartment (approx 65 sqm) sleeps 2 + 1, with a large bedroom and bathroom (plus one.)<br />
Approximately 20 steps down will lead you to the downstairs terrace. Under a bougainvillea pergola shaded by canvas and cotton curtains, a large handmade outdoor table of Vietri tiles allows you to eat or drink in front of the exquisite view of Positano and the Mediterranean Sea.<br />
In front of the terrace is a beautiful grass lawn kept green all year round by a sprinkler system. To the right is a huge, hand-made terracotta vase, which sits next to an old pomegranate tree (wonderful fruit at the end of October and November).<br />
<br />
The <strong>master bedroom </strong>(ca 15 sqm)<strong> </strong>of the smaller apartment looks out at the sea through an all glass arched wall. There is a queen size bed and a built-in closet with drawers.<br />
<br />
The <strong>bathroom </strong>(ca 6 sqm), which adjoins the room, is hand painted hand-made Venetian spatula technique and has a Vietri tiled floor. There is a bathtub, shower, bidet and sink set into a &nbsp;travertine countertop.<br />
<br />
Next to the master bedroom (with its own access to the terrace and a magical view of the sea through a glass wall), the <strong>living room</strong> (ca 40 sqm) is furnished with two white sofas. A large wood dining table separates the living area from the kitchen area, which has a travertine marble sink, dishwasher, retro-style refrigerator and a handmade Vietri tile backsplash.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>The garden</strong><br />
</u>Hidden on the side and below the lawn is a vegetable garden on which our gardener grows tomatoes, potatoes (for which Praiano is famous), eggplant, herbs and delicious wild arugula. When in season all of this produce will be available to you. Our compliments, of course.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>The pool area</u></strong><u><br />
</u>Going down another 20 steps and to the right is the fruit-lined (lemon, plum and apricot) path to the pool area. At the pool, sitting under the pergola, looking out at the sea, with Capri on the horizon and Positano to the right, you will feel like you are in your own private paradise. Three elegant steel lounge chaises and six foldable deck chairs allow you to stay under the sun or rest in the shade while enjoying the sensational view.<br />
<br />
In the pool, the infinity side toward the sea gives the startling feeling of being able to swim straight into the sea.<br />
<br />
A few steps past an outdoor shower, hidden behind stones and a bougainvillea-covered iron cupola, is the fourth terrace. This too faces the sea, Capri and Positano and is shaded by lemon trees. Under the pergola of lemon trees is a hand-made round ceramic table and four iron chairs. It&rsquo;s a perfect spot for drinks at sunset.</p>
